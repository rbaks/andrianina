## Short

I made this blog to showcase some of my creations and share my findings around software engineering. Most of the projects here are open-sourced on Github to let people learn from them by playing around.

## The impact of open source

There is no doubt open source is changing the world because knowledge must be popularized for a country to know development.

Indeed, writing software is a 21st century way of making wealth, if not the most efficient one. This is at least what one of the personalities I appreciate thinks of it in an essay he wrote on [How to Make Wealth](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html) by Paul Graham, a programmer, writer, and investor.

Open source is just a way to encourage innovation, i.e. by making wealth. Without it, many of the technologies we take for granted today would never have developed. This entire website would never have existed.
