summary: 'The reason behind creating this blog.'

I made this blog to showcase some of my creations and share my findings around software engineering. Most of the projects here are open-sourced on Github to let people learn from them by playing around.

## The impact of open source

There is no doubt open source is changing the world because knowledge must be popularized for a country to know development.

Indeed, writing software is a 21st century way of making wealth, if not the most efficient one. This is at least what one of the personalities I appreciate thinks of it in an essay he wrote on [How to Make Wealth](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html) by Paul Graham, a programmer, writer, and investor. 

Open source is just a way to encourage innovation, ie. by making wealth. Without it, many of the technologies we take for granted today would never have developed. This entire website would never have existed.

## The open source community

The open-source encapsulates the idea behind a powerful community that can break barriers made by misleading governments in developing countries. Governments took their supremacy from the people, so why not give that power back to the people? at least hypothetically. This is where the open source community really shines.

We know DeFi projects or [Decentralized Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) that stops Banks from controlling your money thanks to the [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) and [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency). It assures total transparency of transactions and is the most secure way to do so, at least at this time being.

On the other hand, we have decentralized Web or [Web 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) that erradicates any form of content censorhip on the internet. That may be any form of political contestation

In the financial industry, This power currently knows its bests in the financial industry, thanks to the blockchain and cryptocurrencies. I am totally convinced that only communities and entrepreneurs can lead a country to truly sustainable development by leveraging open source projects.

This is a fork of the [tailwind nextjs starter blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) project deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
