# Background

During my software development internship, I was given a task to automate the process of synchronizing multiple schema-like databases coming from different deployment environments. The company I was working for makes websites for their client using [Moodle](https://moodle.org/). They then needed a tool to mimic the usual [CI/CD workflow](#) they have been adopting for a while.

Unlike any other software project, Moodle appears to work like a CMS[^1] (ie.) the entire website is dynamically generated from the database at runtime - even Html and CSS code modifications.

It is therefore unlikely to use any existing DevOps[^2] tool like git and Jenkins. A simple database synchronization could lead to data loss knowing that many databases can have similar primary keys and cause rows to overwrite each other.

Thus, work had to be done. I had 3 months to program a tool to automate a task where, even made manually, is nearly impossible to complete.
This is where Maths does its magic.

# Reformulating the problem

Given an **infinite number** of schema-like databases, write a program to effectively synchronize them into one central database without any primary key collision. The real problem here is collision avoidance. We will then reformulate to **database fusion**.
