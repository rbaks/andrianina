I am a Software developer and AI student born in February 2000 in the capital Antananarivo of Madagascar. With a solid scientific background and a math major, I decided to dedicate my life career to writing software and got my degree in Software Engineering from [IT University](https://www.ituniversity-mg.com/) in 2021.

Hobbyist, I write several side projetcs and try to expose some of them in this personal blog in my free time. Interested in AI and new technologies, I am primarily proficient in stacks used within languages like Rust, Javascript, C/C++, C#, Java, and Python.
