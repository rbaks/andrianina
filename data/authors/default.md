I am a Software developer and AI student born in February 2000 in the capital Antananarivo of Madagascar. With a solid scientific background and a math major, I decided to dedicate my life career to writing software and got my degree in Software Engineering from [IT University](https://www.ituniversity-mg.com/) in 2021. I am now pursuing my study in order to master Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.

Hobbyist, I write several system and backend programs beside my daily job and try to expose some of them in this personal blog in my free time. Interested in Robotics and new technologies, I am diving into embedded programming with Arduinos and ESP32 based development boards to deepen my knowledge. I am primarily proficient in stacks used within languages like Rust, C/C++, Go, C#, Java, and Python.
