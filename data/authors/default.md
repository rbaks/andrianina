I am a Software developer and AI student born in February 2000 in capital Antananarivo, Madagascar. With a solid scientific background and a maths major, I decided to dedicate my life career in writting software and got my degree in Software Engineering from [IT University](https://www.ituniversity-mg.com/) in 2021. I am now pursuing my study in AI and Big Data to obtain the [MSc - Master of Science BIHAR - Big Data & IA - ESTIA](https://www.estia.fr/formations/formations-longues-diplomantes/msc-bihar).

Hobbyist, I write several system and backend programs besides my daily job and tries to expose some of them in this personal blog at my free times. Interested in Robotics and new technologies, I am diving in the embedded programing world with Arduinos and ESP32 based development boards to deepen my knowledge. I am primarily proficient in stacks used within languages like Rust, C/C++, Go, C#, Java and Python.
